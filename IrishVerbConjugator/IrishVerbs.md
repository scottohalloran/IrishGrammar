The Imperative Mood
The imperative is used to give a command or to make a request. 
Because of that, the two forms that are most used are the second person singular and the second person plural.
As noted, the verb stem is the imperative singular.
The imperative plural is formed in the following way:
First Conjugation
The ending -igí is added to a slender one syllable verb stem.
The ending -aigí is added to a broad one syllable verb stem.
The ending -áil and -áin are broadened by dropping the i and then have -aigí added to the end.
With one syllable verbs that have a long vowel and that end in -igh, the -igh is replaced by -igí.
The short vowel in verbs such as nigh and suigh is lengthened.
