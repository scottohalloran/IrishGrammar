Irish verbs have four tenses: present, future, past and past habitual
Irish verbs have four moods: the indicative, the imperative the conditional and the subjunctive.
The Irish equivalent of the infinitive is the stem which is derived from the second person imperative singular of a verb.
There are two conjugations of regular verbs.
Irish has 11 irregular verbs which do not have predictable forms.
The Irish equivalent of the passive is the autonomous form

Most Irish Verbs consist of seven tenses. These are:
Imperative, Present, Future, Present Subjunctive, Past, Habitual Past, an on tiona .
The first four are considered “Primary tenses” and the remaining three are called “Historical tenses”.
Verbs are classified into 2 conjugations. If the third person, singular, future tense form has a -faidh or -fidh ending, it is a 1st conjugation verb. If the third person, singular, future tense form has an -eoidh or -óidh; ending, it is a 2nd conjugation verb.

The verb categories are defined as follows:
v1- = First Conjugation Verbs
v1a - A verb whose stem ending is a broad consonant:
dún, ól.
v1b — A verb whose stem ending is a slender consonant
(excluding those ending in -gh): bris and éist.	
v1b(x) A verb whose stem ending broadens when an ending is added: aidhlaic, agaill, tíolaic.
v1c = A verb that has a polysyllabic stem ending in -ál and -áil
A verb of this type is conjugated as if its stem ends in -ál except that the l is attenuated before a -t: siúil,aisigh , etc.

v1d = A verb that has a monosyllabic stem and ends in
-aeigh, -áigh, -aoigh, -eoigh, -iaigh, -óigh,
-uaigh, or -úigh. It takes a broad f and
slender t in its ending:
dóigh, imchlóigh and eisiaigh, etc.

v1e = A verb that has a monosyllabic stem and ends in -éigh.
It takes a slender f and t in its ending:
léigh and éigh, etc.

v1f = A verb with a slender-ending stem that syncopates and broadens when an ending is added to it: adhain, gleadhair, etc.

vlf(s) = A verb with a slender-ending stem that syncopates and remains slender when an ending is added: feighil and saighid.

vlf(x) = Five verbs that syncopate atypically:
achair (beseech), eisionnail (elute), ionnail (wash), spadhar (exasperate), and tiomain (curse).

v1g = A verb that has a monosyllabic stem that ends in -ígh:
buígh and caígh, etc.

v1h = A verb that has a monosyllabic stem and ends in -igh following a consonant or a short vowel that follows a consonant. An unaccented i is used before -t and -gh:
figh, dligh, dluigh, and guigh.

v1x = One verb that appears to be a type v2b because of its -igh stem ending. Instead, it takes the same endings as a vlb verb: fuirsigh (harrow).

v2- = Second Conjugation Verbs
v2a = A verb that has a polysyllabic stem ending in -aigh:
ceannaigh, smálaigh, etc.
v2a(x) = One verb that has a polysyllabic stem ending in -aigh with an anomalous past form: tarlaigh (happen).

v2b = A verb that has a polysyllabic stem ending in -igh
(except fuirsigh) following a consonant:
imigh, ceistigh, etc.

v2c = A verb that has a polysyllabic stem and ends in -aibh, -ail, -aill, -ain, or -air,
and syncopates when an ending is added:
oscail, ceangail, tuargain, ascain, freagair, cabhair, etc.

v2d = A verb that has a polysyllabic stem and ends in -il, -ill, -in, -ir, or -is, followed by a consonant, and syncopates when an ending is added:

when an ending is added:
foghlaim, díolaim, aithris, fulaing, and tarraing.

but is broadened (if necessary) when an ending is added: freastail, taistil, and lorg.
