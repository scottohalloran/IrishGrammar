Irish verbs have four tenses: present, future, past and past habitual
Irish verbs have four moods: the indicative, the imperative the conditional and the subjunctive.
The Irish equivalent of the infinitive is the stem which is derived from the second person imperative singular of a verb.
There are two conjugations of regular verbs.
Irish has 11 irregular verbs which do not have predictable forms.
The Irish equivalent of the passive is the autonomous form

Most Irish Verbs consist of seven tenses. These are:
Imperative, Present, Future, Present Subjunctive, Past, Habitual Past, an on tiona .
The first four are considered “Primary tenses” and the remaining three are called “Historical tenses”.
Verbs are classified into 2 conjugations. If the third person, singular, future tense form has a -faidh or -fidh ending, it is a 1st conjugation verb. If the third person, singular, future tense form has an -eoidh or -óidh; ending, it is a 2nd conjugation verb.

The verb categories are defined as follows:
v1- = First Conjugation Verbs
v1a - A verb whose stem ending is a broad consonant:
dún, ól.
v1b — A verb whose stem ending is a slender consonant
(excluding those ending in -gh): bris and éist.	
v1b(x) A verb whose stem ending broadens when an ending is added: aidhlaic, agaill, tíolaic.
v1c = A verb that has a polysyllabic stem ending in -ál and -áil
A verb of this type is conjugated as if its stem ends in -ál except that the l is attenuated before a -t: siúil,aisigh , etc.
v1d = A verb that has a monosyllabic stem and ends in
-aeigh, -áigh, -aoigh, -eoigh, -iaigh, -óigh,
-UAijh, or -úijh. It takes a broad p and
slender c in its ending:
nóijh, imchtóijh and eisiAijh, etc. [Class 5 in GMI & GGBC 14.40]
vle = A verb that has a monosyllabic stem and ends in -éijh.
It takes a slender p and c in its ending:
téijh and éijh, etc.	[Class 6 in GMI & GGBC 14.41]
vlf = A verb with a slender-ending stem that syncopates and broadens when an ending is added to it: AuhAin, cojhAiR, etc.
[Class 4 - exceptional conjugation in GMI & GGBC 14.39]
vlf(s) = A verb with a slender-ending stem that syncopates and remains slender when an ending is added: ueijhit and SAijhin.
[Class 2 - exceptional conjugation in GMI & GGBC 14.49]
vlf(x) = Four verbs that syncopate atypically:
AchAiR (beseech), lonnAit (wash), spADhAR (exasperate), and ciomAin (curse).
vlg = A verb that has a monosyllabic stem that ends in -í;h:
cloíjh and CAÍsh, etc.	[Class 7 in GMI & GGBC 14.42]
vlh = A verb that has a monosyllabic stem and ends in -ijh following a consonant or a short vowel that follows a consonant. An unaccented i is used before -c and -jh:
pijh, Rish, snoish, and tonsuijh. [Class 8 in GMI & GGBC 14.43]
vlx = One verb that appears to be a type v2b because of its -ijh stem ending. Instead, it takes the same endings as a vlb verb: puiRSijh (harrow).
[Exceptional class 2 syncopated verbs in GMI & GGBC 14.35]
v2- = Second Conjugation Verbs
v2a = A verb that has a polysyllabic stem ending in -Aijh:
ceAnnAijh, smÁtAish, etc.	[Class 9 in GMI & GGBC 14.45]
